Our aim is to develop and product that will automatically water plants with minimal user interaction,
to make it easier for people to grow their own ingredients or just to have plants for aesthetic
purposes around the house. Our vision is set on creating something transportable and easy to setup and use. 
We also think aesthetics are very important, as every home and person are different, our product
should have a range of designs that can be chosen from to match the users kitchen / style. The device
should be ergonomic in style and have minimal intrusion to its surroundings.
