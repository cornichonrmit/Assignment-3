        <div class="container" align="left">
            <p>There was inspiration to build this product because of the difficult nature of growing produce and the
                limited space people have in their homes. The project was first intended to grow herbs to help increase
                the life span of them. The project is a domestic watering system contained in a pot that will assist
                people to either grow their own produce or house plants. It will be made so it is quickly and easily set
                up to reduce the hassle for the user. The watering system is encased in the pot and it is designed to be
                a product that is bought off the shelf so the user can just pot their plant of choice. In the
                prototype’s current iteration, moisture is detected by the sensor and this information is passed to the
                script. If moisture isn’t detected, the water pump will water the plant until there is water detected.
                When this happens, the water pump will be turned off.
                <br>
                The product has been built by following a tutorial online closely but making the appropriate changes
                that were decided on that would improve the product both aesthetically and functionally. The required
                parts were bought also following the tutorial. There are still further changes that can be made in
                building the product, moving away from the original tutorial. There was a tutorial for a similar
                self-watering pot system using a Raspberry Pi. It was thought that the product could be improved and
                made into a more consumer friendly product. There was research completed online on how the project
                worked and also how the accompanying technology would work with the product.
                <br>
                There was a learning process involved with using the Raspberry Pi with both the wiring and the
                programming. The OS was installed on the Raspberry Pi and research was conducted on the GPIO pins worked
                with the different components of the product. The wiring wasn’t too difficult to learn, the tutorial was
                a helpful guide. The process of learning how to code with python was difficult, much harder than
                originally anticipated.
                <br>
                The moisture sensor was set up as a test first – to see if water was present or not. A program was
                created using Python that detected if the sensor worked giving back a 1 or 0 to the Raspberry Pi on the
                console window. When the test was found to be successful, the program was changed to be the final
                product. This was finished in three days, the process taking longer than expected.
                <br>
                The project went smoothly for the most part, there were a couple of minor hiccups. Including a minor
                electrocution while the product was being made. This was an error by the manufacturer of part that was
                used and there is no possibility of this happening to the end user.
                <br>
                A 3D printed case to house the electronics of the watering system would be made to help improve the
                aesthetics of our current prototype. It would be attached to the side of the pot. The case could also be
                made with an openable lid so the user can adjust and look at the wires / electronics. Another change for
                aesthetic reasons would be to build the water tubing into the top lip of the pot to hide it.
                <br>
                Another future implementation would be to create an interface so the user can check on their plants
                remotely. HTML would be the language used to program the interface. There could also be an option to
                make a web monitoring system, connecting a camera or a webcam so the user can see their plants and not
                just the water level in the soil.
                <br>
                There are many possible changes for future versions of the product. There could be a version of the pot
                that has a touch screen on the side of the pot with different options to help the user control and
                customise the moisture levels of their plants. This customisation would help to increase the range of
                plants that would be compatible with the pot, not limiting the user to plants that constantly need the
                soil wet, which is the only option that the water system has at the moment. The screen that would be
                built into the pot would have to be a small screen, but not too small as it wouldn’t be worth having. If
                the pot was larger to house a larger screen, it would decrease the feasibility of the product appealing
                to a domestic consumer, which is the target demographic. A bigger screen would also incur a larger price
                which would increase the end price for the consumer.
                <br>
                There are plans for improving the product including making the software more aware of the amount of
                liquid that is present in the soil, so the plant receives the amount of water it needs, rather than
                watering the soil every time the soil is dry. Adding a humidity sensor that is linked to a humidifier
                would help to understand of the plant needed any moisture regulation.
                <br>
                The product will help with the issue of watering the plant, but the user will have to deal with diseases
                the plant contracts and the consequences of insects eating their plant. The product doesn’t have any
                plans to prevent these problems.
                <br>
                The reference that was used to help build the product used a different moisture sensor to the one that
                was used in the project. Research was made to learn the basics of how to connect “things” to the
                Raspberry Pi which was done by watching multiple videos and looking at other tutorials. From this
                information, the way that the GPIO pins worked on the Raspberry Pi. The GPIO pins had been implemented
                into python code so values could be both read and written from the moisture sensor.
                <br>
                Bought a different one and could change the moisture sensor to detect the percentage of the water
                moistness. The one in the example had a scale for the moisture level, so it could be accurately
                measured. It doesn’t impact the overall performance of the product; it just isn’t as accurate as it
                could be. This can be changed in the future.
                <br>
                Moisture sensor was originally created to be used in conjunction with the Arduino, there was a
                possibility to have to buy another model that was compatible with the raspberry pi. Got the moisture
                sensor to work with the raspberry pi, no documentation available to make it compatible with the
                raspberry pi. Overcame this problem by spending a week doing research on how the moisture sensor and the
                raspberry pi worked.
                <br>
                Changes were made in the way the water pumped into the plant with a sprinkler design compared to the
                reference that was found online. In the tutorial, only a single water outlet was used, there was a
                modification from this plan, however, to create a sprinkler design so the water could be distributed
                around the pot and the plant evenly. There is a problem with the water covering a larger area of the
                pot, the pot will have to be designed so the wiring of the system doesn’t come into contact with the
                water. A possible way to combat this issue would be to put heat shrink on the electrical component of
                the sensor.
                <br>
                Another change to the product that will help the functionality of the system would be to change the way
                the water enters the pot. It would be changed to have multiple entry holes around the base of the pot
                for the water so the plant is evenly watered.
