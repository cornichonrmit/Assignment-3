                The Automatic Plant Watering System unit will be rigorously tested for any design defects or failures
                which may impact the operational functions of the device. The planned tests will cover different
                environments experienced by the device, which may consist of multiple temperature and climate exposure.
                There will be 10 planned tests to check for software resilience to perform under extreme circumstances.
                <br>The extreme weather climate testing will be applied with the static temperature ranging from -18° to
                50° Celsius; the aim of this test is to check if the components are performing as expected like during
                normal conditions. The components that are critical to the success of the test are the auxiliary power
                unit and sensors are infallible to the climate.
                <br>The language used by the software is Python, primarily because Raspberry PI operates through this
                means of communication and it is relatively simple to code and interact in programming. Our team is
                proficient of using Python programming language which makes the project easier to fulfil the functional
                requirements. It is expected that debugging the code will help assess the logical flow of the software,
                in which amendments could be made before live testing of the product.
                <br>Essentially, the software and hardware will undergo stringent testing to fulfil the reliability and
                operational requirements of the design. For the assurance of reliability and quality, the product is to
                have 10 continuously successful test results, however if there are any defects found during any stage of
                the testing, the team will need assess the prototype’s failure and testing will have to restart from the
                beginning.
                <br>If there are any problems revealed during the product testing, the team will revert to design mode
                and assess the implications caused by the fault. Once the team is satisfied with the rectification of
                the solution, the product will begin testing with basic systems test and focus more directly to the fix.
                <br>BASIC SYSTEMS TEST:
                <br>APWS normal operations examination of software and hardware.
                <br>DEGRADED SYSTEMS TEST:
                <br>Deficiency in system capabilities which is checked for any spectacular failure.
                <br>EXTREME SYSTEMS TEST:
                <br>Under the most extreme conditions, the test is designed to check the endurance of the product.
