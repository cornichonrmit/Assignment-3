Everyone in the group had completed their appointed part of the assignment before the due date. We could’ve had more communication during our tutorials particularly about our specific progress. We hadn’t arranged to meet up outside of the tutorials and we should have, due to there usually being a member missing during the tutorial. It was more difficult to measure the progress of team members because of the constant absences of specific members.  The group was super agreeable, everyone was willing to compromise and work as a team to get the best outcome for the group. There also wasn’t a specific leader, everyone was truly an equal in the group. Having a positive group dynamic made it really easy to work with the other members of the group. There wasn’t as much collaboration in the group work than I originally expected. As we decided and divided the work evenly at the beginning of the assignment, there wasn’t a huge need for constant communication. Every member of the group was willing to complete their part of the assignment to a high standard.
