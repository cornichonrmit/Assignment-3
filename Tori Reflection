All of the group members completed their assigned workload before the due date to a high standard. We should’ve taken the initiative to create times where we could have worked on the assignment as a group outside of our designated tutorial. Most weeks throughout the project there was one member missing which made it difficult to understand how people were going with the progress of their work. More communication was also needed at the start of the assignment with Mike as we were working on his project and the other members didn’t know all of the specifics and intricacies of his project. Working with the group was just as enjoyable as the last assignment. The different personalities of the group made a super interesting dynamic that was fun to work in. These differences actually complementary instead of them clashing with each other. Working out what part of the assignment every member was going to do at the start of the project provided a good foundation of the expectations that we all expected from each other. We decided to do this process again because of the success it brought us with the previous assignment. Overall, this assignment went just as smoothly as the previous assignment did.
