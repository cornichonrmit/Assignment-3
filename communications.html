            <p>At CornichonRMIT, our mission to successfully deliver the project is a top priority which means that
                communication between team members is an essential aspect of the group’s culture. The communication
                between team members is endorsed with freedom and honesty to minimise the risk of misunderstanding and
                inadequate information being shared.
                <br>Each week during the assigned tutorials, each group member is expected to have reached a checkpoint
                to prevent rushing and improved task quality. We all have the responsibility to raise concerns and
                matters regarding the project as soon as possible so that the team’s course of action is carefully
                guided towards the primary goal.
                <br>In the event that a team member has not provided any communication during group discussions, the
                group as a collective will attempt to show empathy and consideration for the team member and their state
                of well being. This depends on the circumstances imposed that an individual may have become withdrawn
                from the activities due to personal reasons. If a team member fails to provide a valid reason for being
                withdrawn from the group, disciplinary action may be requested for the Tutor to help assist in the
                situation which may lead to disciplinary action.
                <br>Outside of class, there are no mandatory meetings required – this is circumstance driven as long as
                there are no emergencies.
                <br>The remote method of communication being used is Facebook Messenger. The software has already proven
                itself in the live field with millions of users seamlessly communicating with each other, which means
                that the group has a reliable and practical way to share their ideas in the group chat. Facebook
                Messenger exists in the form of a mobile application and is also readily accessible via a web version
                for desktops.
