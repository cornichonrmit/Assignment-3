            <h2>Group Processes Based On Assignment 2 Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                Upon reviewing our reflection’s with regards to Assignment 2, there were some common themes around what
                worked well, as well as areas in which we can improve. Many team members commented on how designating
                tasks early in the assignment was paramount to our success, enabling each member to know their
                responsibilities. Another positive comment that became apparent was the willingness of individuals to
                work outside of their scope in order to assist their team mates.
                <br>Communication was a key aspect to our success in Assignment 2. Although team members found our
                communication methods to be effective, we highlighted some areas that we are endeavouring to improve on
                for assignment 3. The main aspect of this is tracking each other’s progress, and any difficulties they
                are facing throughout the week between classes. To combat this issue, for Assignment 3 we have
                implemented a work management board through Office365 planner - See Button below, or alternatively, the
                Organisations at the bottom of the page for the link.
                <br>When tasks are grouped by “Assigned To” other team members can navigate through each other’s tasks
                and see where they are up to via the comments we are making throughout our progress. This board has also
                further enabled individuals to offer assistance outside their personal scope, if they can see that a
                team mates work load is higher than initially estimated.
                <br>Tasks can also be grouped by due date, allowing us a timeline overview of the project, which in turn
                allows us to monitor each other’s progress and offer assistance as required. This has the added benefit
                of acting similar to a Gantt chart in that tasks are scheduled to start only once other tasks have
                reached their scheduled completion date, As the team outlines the project timeline, this feature becomes
                pivotal in our work management process.
                <br>Another area that was highlighted as being in need of improvement was our in-class meeting
                productivity. We had no structure to any discussions that took place, or support for any issues
                encountered. To rectify this, in Assignment 3, we have designated the first part of each tutorial to a
                group discussion in which each member in turn reports on their progress the previous week, and
                highlights any ongoing issues. We then put a plan in place to combat the ongoing issues so that each
                team member is on the same page.
                <br>Finally, a number of team members expressed issues with using Github during Assignment 2. To combat
                this, the team members who are more experienced in this area are assigned the responsibility of
                supporting other team members when issues are encountered, as well as managing the artifacts as a whole.

        <div class="container" align="left">
            <h2>Career Aspirations</h2>
            <p>
                The Cornichon group members have a variety of career aspirations, ranging from Java & .NET Developers,
                to System Engineer, UX Designer and Business Analyst. There are many common elements between roles,
                predominantly in the soft skill requirements of the role, although, there are also some common traits
                between the roles in regards to required hard skills. The area in which the roles differ is in the role
                specific hard skills. Each of our career plans contain similar elements, and vary mostly on the specific
                requirements of these elements.
                <br> As stated, there is a wide variety of career aspirations across the six team members that make up
                Cornichon. That being said, three members of Cornichon aspire to become software developers of some
                description. Whether it be in Java, .NET, or another language as required, all three members have a
                passion for full stack development. One member of team Cornichon has expressed an interest in the
                communications hardware and configuration predominant field of System Engineer. One member of the group
                has a passion for creativity and design, and wishes to design and develop products based on user
                experience. This particular role is a more client interactive role than those previously mentioned, yet
                still requires the front-end development skills. Our last member has chosen the role of Business Analyst
                as their ideal job. This role is centred around knowing and understanding all aspects of the business as
                a whole, and interacting with both internal and external stakeholders, with less of a focus on the
                specialty technical skills the other roles have defined.
            </p>
            <h2>Ideal Job Common Elements</h2>
            <p>
                <br> Our chosen roles each have their own unique hard skill requirement elements, yet many required hard
                skills are either the same or very similar. For example, four of the six desired roles are development /
                design roles which require experience in web technologies, with emphasis on at least one form of
                JavaScript framework / library. Drilling down further, three of those four roles have requirements for
                experience in a C-based language.
                <br>In regards to soft skills, the majority of requirements are common to all roles. Obviously, some
                experience in the field is a requirement for all roles, as well as teamwork skills being highly regarded
                in the majority of the ideal job adverts. Communication skills are the next most frequently mentioned
                requirements. Other common traits required, although expressed in different words across the job
                adverts, are skills such as the ability and desire to expand one’s knowledge, or to seek and find
                information.
            </p>
            <h2>Ideal Job Differences</h2>
            <p>
                <br>The area in which our ideal jobs differ is predominantly in the role specific hard skills. Each role
                has their own specific skill set, depending on the technologies the company uses. Even though two of the
                ideal jobs have the same job title of Java Developer, their advertised skill requirements vary quite
                significantly. One focuses on knowledge of specific frameworks, libraries and build tools, whereas the
                other is more focused on the knowledge of a range of programming languages. All four of the developer
                /designer roles have requirements regarding JavaScript framework and cloud technologies experience, but
                the specific frameworks and technologies differ from role to role.
                <br>Both the UX Designer role and the Business Analyst role make mention of communication skills, but
                the differ on who the role is required to communicate with, one dealing with customers, the other with
                the business as a whole. The most different of all the roles is the Systems Engineer role. All of the
                technology requirements of this role are unique in the job advertisements, and with the exception of
                SQL, are in a field of their own, that is networks and communications.
            </p>
            <h2>Comparing Career Plans</h2>
            <p>
                <br>Across the Cornichon group, our career plans are very similar. We all have some base knowledge in
                our chosen field, which has sparked our interest to further pursue the required knowledge. We all
                believe the skills we gain throughout our degree, although the skills will vary from person to person,
                will lay a solid foundation for us to enter the workforce and gain the required work experience to fill
                our ideal roles.
                <br>Some group members have identified steps they will take above and beyond our Degree requirements, to
                further expand their knowledge base such as undertaking online learning, or getting involved in clubs or
                group projects outside of University and work. Involvement in clubs and group projects, along with
                attending networking events have been identified as beneficial in that a wider professional network will
                provide greater opportunities to gain employment in one of our ideal roles.
