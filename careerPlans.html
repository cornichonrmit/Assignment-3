            <h2>Group Processes Based On Assignment 2 Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                Upon reviewing our reflection’s with regards to Assignment 2, there were some common themes around what
                worked well, as well as areas in which we can improve. Many team members commented on how designating
                tasks early in the assignment was paramount to our success, enabling each member to know their
                responsibilities. Another positive comment that became apparent was the willingness of individuals to
                work outside of their scope in order to assist their team mates.
                <br>Communication was a key aspect to our success in Assignment 2. Although team members found our
                communication methods to be effective, we highlighted some areas that we are endeavouring to improve on
                for assignment 3. The main aspect of this is tracking each other’s progress, and any difficulties they
                are facing throughout the week between classes. To combat this issue, for Assignment 3 we have
                implemented a work management board through Office365 planner - See Button below, or alternatively, the
                Organisations at the bottom of the page for the link.
                <br>When tasks are grouped by “Assigned To” other team members can navigate through each other’s tasks
                and see where they are up to via the comments we are making throughout our progress. This board has also
                further enabled individuals to offer assistance outside their personal scope, if they can see that a
                team mates work load is higher than initially estimated.
                <br>Tasks can also be grouped by due date, allowing us a timeline overview of the project, which in turn
                allows us to monitor each other’s progress and offer assistance as required. This has the added benefit
                of acting similar to a Gantt chart in that tasks are scheduled to start only once other tasks have
                reached their scheduled completion date, As the team outlines the project timeline, this feature becomes
                pivotal in our work management process.
                <br>Another area that was highlighted as being in need of improvement was our in-class meeting
                productivity. We had no structure to any discussions that took place, or support for any issues
                encountered. To rectify this, in Assignment 3, we have designated the first part of each tutorial to a
                group discussion in which each member in turn reports on their progress the previous week, and
                highlights any ongoing issues. We then put a plan in place to combat the ongoing issues so that each
                team member is on the same page.
                <br>Finally, a number of team members expressed issues with using Github during Assignment 2. To combat
                this, the team members who are more experienced in this area are assigned the responsibility of
                supporting other team members when issues are encountered, as well as managing the artifacts as a whole.

                Career Plans
                Compare and contrast the career plans, including ideal jobs, for each person in the
                group. This may have changed due to feedback from Assignments 1 and 2. What
                common elements are there, if any? What differentiates each position from the others,
                if anything? How similar or different are your career plans across the group? This is
                new for this assignment.
